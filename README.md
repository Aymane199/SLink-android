# Architecture overview
The app is a stateless client: all operations are performed
by calling api endpoints over the network.

Local data is in effect immutable, the client just downloads versions of data as needed. 

The data is stored as Observables objects in Model class. We interact with the api using REST client retrofit which is implemented in repository classes, repository classes send requests and according to the response it updates the model objects.  

- /**Activities**	*(contains all activities of the app)*
- /**Adapter**	*(contains dataAdapters)*
- /**Component**	*(contains reusable components)*
- /**Fragment** 	*(contains all fragments of the app)*
- /**Listener**	*(contains listener)*
- /**Model**		*(contains observable objects)*
- /**Repository**	*(contains implementation of retrofit interface - send requests to Api & update modelâ€™s objects)*
- /**Retrofit**	*(contains retrofit interfaces)*
- /**Services**	*(contains background services)*
- /**Table**		*(contains entities used)*
- /**utils**		*(contains enum classes & useful classes)*
